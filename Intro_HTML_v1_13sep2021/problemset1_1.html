        <p>HTML code live inside angled brackets called HTML elements. Elements are 
            usually made up of two tags: an opening tag and a closing tag. The closing tag 
            has an extra forward slash in it.</p>
        <p>Attributes provide additional information about the contents of an element. 
            They appear on the opening tag of the element and are made up of two parts: 
            a name and a value, separated by an equals sign.</p>
        <ul>
            <li>The attribute name indicates what kind of extra information you are 
                supplying about the element's content. It is written in lowercase.</li>
            <li>The value is the information or setting for the attribute. It is placed in 
                double quotes. Different attributes can have different values.</li>
        </ul>
        <p>When creating a web page, you add tags to the contents. These tags provide extra 
            meaning and allow browsers to show users the appropriate structure for the page.</p>
         <ul>
            <li>Structural markup: the elements that you can use to describe both headings and paragraphs</li>
            <li>Semantic markup: provides extra information, such as where emphasis is placed in a sentence, that something
                you have written is a quotation (and who said it), the meaning of acronyms, and so on</li>
        </ul>
